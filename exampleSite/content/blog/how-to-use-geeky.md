Congrats on finding the perfect theme for your blog. You have great taste that's for sure, this guide will help you get your blog up and running with the Geeky theme in no time.

#### Let's Get Geeking
First, if you haven't already, you'll need to download the [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) programming language. Hugo is built on Go, so it's essential to have it installed before you can use Hugo.

Next, proceed to install [hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/)

- **Mac**
```Bash
brew install hugo
```
or

```Bash 
sudo port install hugo
```


- **Windows**
```Bash
choco install hugo-extended
```

- **Linux**
```Bash
sudo apt install hugo
```

If you encounter any issues, please refer to the [hugo installation docs](https://gohugo.io/installation/) for better details.

Next you'll need a text editor, personally I use VScode but any text editor will do, neovim, nano, notepad etc. Although you should have a terminal ready to go.

<br>

Clone the geeky repository.
Open your terminal and enter the following command:
```Bash
 $ git clone git@github.com:statichunt/geeky-hugo.git
```

After cloning, navigate into the newly cloned repository with:
```Bash
 $ cd geeky-hugo
```
<br>

If you don't already have [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), I recommend downloading it. It will simplify the management of this directory. However, if you're already using another text editor, the instructions provided will be applicable to any editor you choose.


Open the folder in vscode or your preferred text editor:
```Bash
 $ code .
```
You'll see a bunch of folders here. Don't worry, we're only going to adjust a few of them.

{{< image src="images/post/post-1/pic1.png" caption="screenshot1" alt="alter-text" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q100" class="img-fluid" title="image title" webp="false" >}}

Look for a folder named `exampleSite`.This is where you'll customize your blog to your liking. But before we get into that, let's take a look at the `config.toml` file in the root directory.


In this file, you can make some changes to customize the look of your blog. For example, you can change the main color of your blog's theme by replacing the current color in `color_primary` with your desired color. You can also update other options, like the font size, to match your style.

```toml
    ######################### site variables ##############################
    # customize your color and font from here.
    [params.variables]
    color_primary = "#2ba283"
    body_color = "#FFF"
    text_color = "#555"
    text_dark = "#222"
    text_light = "#999"
    border_color = "#E1E1E1"
    black = "#000"
    white = "#FFF"
    light = "#f2f2f2"

    # font variables
    # base font size for full website, 
    font_size = "15px" # default is 16px


```

Now navigate to the `exampleSite` folder:
```Bash
 $ cd exampleSite
```

If everything is set up correctly, this command should work:
```Bash
$ hugo server --themesDir ../..
```
<br>

Awesome we can now access the site at: `http://localhost:1313/geeky-hugo/`

<br>

{{< image src="images/post/post-1/pic2.png" caption="screenshot2" alt="alter-text" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q100" class="img-fluid" title="image title" webp="false" >}}


<br>

The site isn't quite ready for production yet. There's still a few things that need to be configured.

The `assets`, `config`, and `content` folders are the ones we'll be working with the most. Here's a brief overview of each:

{{< image src="images/post/post-1/pic3.png" caption="screenshot3" alt="alter-text" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q100" class="img-fluid" title="image title" webp="false" >}}

#### Assets
This folder will hold all the static files for your blog. The only thing that should matter to you here is the images, this is where you store all your images.
The images you see above including the blog banner:

{{< image src="images/post/post-1/pic4.png" caption="screenshot4" alt="alter-text" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q100" class="img-fluid" title="image title" webp="false" >}}

#### Config

As the name suggests, we'll be doing a bit of setup to get your blog ready for production. Just kidding, it's actually quite simple!

{{< image src="images/post/post-1/pic5.png" caption="screenshot5" alt="alter-text" height="" width="" position="center" command="fill" option="q100" class="img-fluid" title="image title" webp="false" >}}

Let's kick things off with the `config.toml` file:

```toml
########################### default configuration ####################
baseURL = "https://demo.statichunt.com/geeky-hugo/"
title = "Geeky | Hugo Personal Blog Template"
theme = "geeky-hugo"
languageName = "En"
languageCode = "en-us"
# post pagination
paginate = "6"
# post excerpt
summaryLength = "20"
# google analytics
googleAnalytics = "" # example: UA-123-45, for more info, read the article https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008080?hl=en
# disqus short name
disqusShortname = "themefisher-template" # get your shortname form here : https://disqus.com
# disable language
disableLanguages = ["fr"] # example: ["fr"] for disable french language
```

**Configuration Overview:**

- **Set the `baseURL`** to match the domain name you want your site to use:

```toml
baseURL = "https://blog.example.com"
```

Ensure it starts with "https://" or "http://".

- **Define the `title`**, which serves as the meta title tag. Choose a title that reflects your blog's content:

```toml
title = "Geeky | Hugo Personal Blog Template"
```

- **Ensure the theme remains as specified**:

```toml
theme = "geeky-hugo"
```

- **Adjust post pagination** by setting the `paginate` value:

```toml
# Post pagination
paginate = 6
```

- **Integrate Google Analytics and Disqus** for site analytics and comments:

  1. **Google Analytics:**
     - Obtain your Google Analytics tracking ID.
     - Update the `googleAnalytics` setting:

```toml
googleAnalytics = "UA-12345678-9" # Replace with your actual tracking ID
```

  2. **Disqus:**
     - Sign up for a Disqus account and obtain your Disqus shortname.
     - Update the `disqusShortname` setting:

```toml
# Disqus short name
disqusShortname = "your-disqus-shortname" # Replace with your actual Disqus shortname
```

- **Specify the primary language of your site, its code, and choose to disable any additional languages as needed**:

```toml
languageName = "English"
languageCode = "en-US"
disableLanguages = ["fr"]
```

**Next Steps:**

- **menus.toml**: Contains all the menus for your blog. You typically do not need to make any changes here unless you wish to remove or add a menu.
- **module.toml**: Contains a list of all the dependencies for the blog. There's generally no need to modify this file.

##### params.toml
This file is where we'll be doing a significant amount of configuration.

```

Adjust these settings according to your blog's requirements and preferences.



#### Content 

Inside the `content` folder, you'll find the `blog` folder, which is where all your articles are stored in Markdown files (e.g., `post-2.md`, `post-3.md`, etc.). Before creating new articles, delete the previous posts or update them as they are just demos. Simply create a new `.md` file. Markdown (.md) is a lightweight markup language for plain-text formatting. Articles within these .md files are composed in Hugo's Markdown format.
To learn more about Hugo Markdown check out the official Hugo documentation at [https://gohugo.io/documentation/](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).

The first thing you add into the `.md` file is the front matter. The front matter block is typically placed at the beginning of a Markdown file (.md) or other content files in Hugo. It provides important metadata that Hugo uses to generate the static site. When Hugo builds the site, it reads this metadata and uses it to generate the appropriate HTML templates and content.

Begin your article with the following front matter and modify it as necessary:

```markdown
---
title: "your post title"
description: "meta description"
image: "images/post/post-1.png"
date: 2021-01-24T18:19:25+06:00
categories: ["category"]
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
type: "regular" # available types: [featured/regular]
draft: false
---
```

After the front matter, you can begin writing your article.


For content files that aren't located within the `blog` directory, such as `about.md`, `contact.md`, `privacy-policy.md`, and `search.md` These files populate the on your site. Adjust them as needed:

Example:
- **About Page** (`about.md`)

This file is used to create an "About" section on your site. It includes details about you

```markdown
---
title: "About The Author"
description: "this is meta-description"
image: "images/author.png"
layout: "about"
draft: false

# education
education:
 enable: true
 title: "Formal Education"
 ...

# experience
experience:
 enable: true
 ...
```
Once you're done setting everything up, your blog should be ready to go live.

There's a lot more that we couldn't cover here, but you can find more information in the [Hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/). So go check it out, and happy geeking!
